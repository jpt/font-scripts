The Family Steps Interpolator is probably a fork of [Linus Romer's steminterpolator]( https://github.com/linusromer/steminterpolation), so it also carries the GNU GPLv3 license; see `GPL` file.

Font tools [developed for the "Barlow" family](https://github.com/jpt/barlow/tree/master/tools) and mirred here are licensed under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL) v1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web) where applicable, and/or the [Apache License 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) where the OFL is inapplicable. 

The rest of it is [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/); "intellectual property" is an oxymoron.
