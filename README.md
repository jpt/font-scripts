# Font Scripts

Scripts/plugins for various font ecosystems. Temporarily limited to Glyphs.

Glyphs 2 scripts have been deleted as they are not maintained. You can still [access them in git history](https://github.com/jpt/font-scripts/tree/d27490b3c5ae165ae3451f593ae7bd42cd0b728a/Glyphs/Glyphs%202) if you need them.

## License

The Family Steps Interpolator (archived, Glyphs 2 only) uses bits of [Linus Romer's steminterpolator]( https://github.com/linusromer/steminterpolation), so it also carries the GPLv3 license.
